### RecycleX

## Inspiration
Recycling is often confusing with many different materials which seem like they can be recycled but actually can't.  Also while many people want to recycle, they often lack the incentive to do so. With our gamification of recycling, it provides motivations while making the users feel good that they are practicing sustainable practices.

## What it does

Users take pictures of items they think are recyclable and upload them to our website. Images are classified and if the item is recyclable the user gains points which are shown on the leaderboard.

## How we built it

Utilizing Gemini API, Cloudflare Workers for image classification and deployment. TailwindCSS was utilized for the frontend. ChatGPT was used for some code development, all or most of the images, and for parts of the brainstorming process.

## Challenges we ran into

Figuring out how to how to integrate frontend and backend as well as dealing with several merge conflicts with git.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Getting the UI mostly finished by the deadline and chatbot integration working.

## What we learned
